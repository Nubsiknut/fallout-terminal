# fallout-terminal
Terminal made with HTML/CSS/JS who looks like terminal and Pip-Boy in Fallout.

## In what it is made?

This "terminal" inspired by Fallout is fully made of HTML/CSS/JS. I haven't use any images, everything is written in CSS!

## TODO

- Work on JS : add user interaction (commands).
- Better animations?
